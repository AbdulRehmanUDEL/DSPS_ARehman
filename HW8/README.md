# FBB

you are missing the readme file. It looks like you are missing it in all your repos. This was a requirement from HW 1

this means you lost a ton of points for a silly mistake!

in this homework you get 80% of the point since the HW was exactly to make a plot and include it in the README  so that it would display at the front of the survey, and with a caption.
